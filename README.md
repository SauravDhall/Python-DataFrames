# Python-DataFrames

Situation: Faced fragmented and inconsistent project and employee datasets that hindered accurate performance tracking, bonus allocation, and visibility into workforce productivity.

Task: Designed and implemented an end-to-end Python-based data pipeline to clean, integrate, and transform employee and project records into a consolidated analytical Final DataFrame for bonus and promotion insights.

Action: Built modular CSV-based data ingestion workflows, standardized employee attributes (name parsing, data normalization), merged multi-source datasets, computed performance-driven bonus metrics, and applied conditional workforce logic to produce a high-quality, analytics-ready dataset.

Result: Delivered a unified, automated reporting dataset that improved data integrity, enabled scalable high-performer identification, and supported data-driven HR and project management decision-making.
